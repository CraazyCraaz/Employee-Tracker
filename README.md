Design the following database schema containing three tables:


* **department**:

  * **id** - INT PRIMARY KEY
  * **name** - VARCHAR(30) to hold department name

* **role**:

  * **id** - INT PRIMARY KEY
  * **title** -  VARCHAR(30) to hold role title
  * **salary** -  DECIMAL to hold role salary
  * **department_id** -  INT to hold reference to department role belongs to

* **employee**:

  * **id** - INT PRIMARY KEY
  * **first_name** - VARCHAR(30) to hold employee first name
  * **last_name** - VARCHAR(30) to hold employee last name
  * **role_id** - INT to hold reference to role employee has
  * **manager_id** - INT to hold reference to another employee that manager of the current employee. This field may be null if the employee has no manager
  
Build a command-line application that at a minimum allows the user to:

  * Add departments, roles, employees

  * View departments, roles, employees

  * Update employee roles

How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:

* Use the [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.

* Use [InquirerJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/0.2.3) NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.

* Use [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console. There is a built-in version of `console.table`, but the NPM package formats the data a little better for our purposes.

* You may wish to have a separate file containing functions for performing specific SQL queries you'll need to use. Could a constructor function or a class be helpful for organizing these?

* You will need to perform a variety of SQL JOINS to complete this assignment

### Hints

* You may wish to include a `seed.sql` file to pre-populate your database. This will make development of individual features much easier.
